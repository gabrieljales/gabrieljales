# Hi, I'm Gabriel :wave: :man_technologist:

I'm a computer science student at UERN, 

#### My favorite technologies are:
* **Python3:** It was my first language and also my first contact with programming. This is where it all started!
* **Django:** Initially, I started to study this framework for a project from my college.
Django was my starting point in web development and it is the tool that I am focusing on at the moment.
